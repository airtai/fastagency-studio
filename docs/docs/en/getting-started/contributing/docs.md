## How to help

You will be of invaluable help if you contribute to the documentation.

Such a contribution can be:

* Indications of inaccuracies, errors, typos
* Suggestions for editing specific sections
* Making additions

You can report all this in [discussions](https://github.com/airtai/fastagency/discussions){.external-link targer="_blank"} on GitHub, start [issue](https://github.com/airtai/fastagency/issues){.external-link targer="_blank"}, or write about it in our [discord](https://discord.gg/qFm6aSqq59){.external-link targer="_blank"} group.

!!! note
    Special thanks to those who are ready to offer help with the case and help in **developing documentation**, as well as translating it into **other languages**.

## How to get started

To develop the documentation, you don't even need to install the entire **FastAgency** project as a whole.

Enough:

1. Clone the project repository
2. Create a virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate it
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4. Install documentation dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install ".[devdocs]"
    ```
5. Go to the `docs/` directory
6. Start the local documentation server
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

Now all changes in the documentation files will be reflected on your local version of the site.
After making all the changes, you can issue a `PR` with them - and we will gladly accept it!
