            <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mb-2'>Payment and Subscription</h2>
            <p>By subscribing to FastAgency, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
            <br />
            <ul className='list-decimal pl-6'>
              <li>
                <b>Subscription:</b> FastAgency is offered on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a
                recurring and periodic basis (each period is referred to as a "billing cycle"). Billing cycles are set
                either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
                purchasing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Payments:</b> All payments are processed by our payment partner, Stripe. By providing a payment
                method, you expressly authorize us and Stripe to charge the subscription fees at the start of every
                billing cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>No Refunds:</b> Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used
                periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to your subscription
                through the end of your current billing cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cancellation:</b> You can cancel your subscription at any time. Please note that you must cancel your
                subscription before it renews for a subsequent billing cycle in order to avoid being charged for the
                next billing cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Changes:</b> We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service
                in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.
              </li>
